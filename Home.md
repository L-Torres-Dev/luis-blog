Hello, my name is Luis Torres and I am a software developer who is constantly learning. I like to write about my findings on my journey through blog posts as it gives me the opportunity to put my thoughts on virtual "paper". If someone happens to find any of my articles useful then all the better!

I originally was writing my blogs on [Medium](https://medium.com/)
## Some of my personal favorite topics
- [[Coroutines Deep Dive!]]
- [[Abstraction Unveiled - What really is an Interface]]
- [[Singleton Pattern - The Most Misunderstood Design Pattern]]
